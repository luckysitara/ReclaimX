# ReclaimX Protocol

A secure, cross-chain wallet recovery and crypto inheritance protocol built with LayerZero V2 OApp messaging between Solana and EVM chains.

## üéØ Overview

ReclaimX enables users to recover their wallets across different blockchains using a decentralized guardian-based system. The protocol supports bidirectional recovery between Solana and Ethereum with time-locked security mechanisms, guardian staking via RXOFT tokens, and inheritance features for long-term asset protection.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components

1. **GuardianVault (Solana Program)** - Main vault contract storing guardian configuration, recovery state, and asset tracking
2. **RecoveryInitiator (EVM Contract)** - Handles recovery initiation and cross-chain messaging on EVM chains
3. **ReclaimXOFT (EVM Contract)** - LayerZero V2 OFT token for guardian staking and slashing mechanisms
4. **LayerZero V2 OApp** - Enables secure cross-chain communication with DVN validation
5. **React Frontend** - Professional UI for vault management, recovery operations, and monitoring

### Supported Chains (Production Ready)

- **Solana Devnet** - EID: 40168, Endpoint: `76y77prsiCMvXMjuoZ5VRrhG5qYBrUMYTE5WgHqgjEn6`
- **Solana Mainnet** - EID: 30168, Endpoint: `76y77prsiCMvXMjuoZ5VRrhG5qYBrUMYTE5WgHqgjEn6`
- **Ethereum Mainnet** - EID: 30101, Endpoint: `0x1a44076050125825900e736c501f859c50fe728c`
- **Ethereum Sepolia** - EID: 40161, Endpoint: `0x6EDCE65403992e310A62460808c4b910D972f10f`

### LayerZero V2 Integration

The protocol uses LayerZero V2 OApp and OFT patterns for cross-chain messaging:

- **Solana Program**: Implements `lz_receive` and `lz_send` instructions using official LayerZero Solana SDK
- **EVM Contracts**: Extend LayerZero's `OApp` and `OFT` base contracts
- **Message Types**: Recovery initiation, guardian voting, vault synchronization, and asset transfers
- **Security**: Multi-DVN validation, trusted peer verification, and replay protection
- **Token Bridge**: RXOFT token transfers for guardian staking across chains

## üîê Security Features

### Guardian-Based Recovery
- **Configurable Threshold**: Set custom guardian approval requirements (e.g., 2-of-3, 3-of-5)
- **Multi-chain Requirement**: Guardians must be distributed across at least 2 different chains
- **Staking Mechanism**: Guardians must stake RXOFT tokens to participate
- **Slashing Protection**: Malicious guardians (3+ false approvals) lose staked tokens

### Time-Locked Security
- **Recovery Delays**: Configurable timelock periods (24-168 hours) prevent rushed recoveries
- **Cancellation Windows**: Original owners can cancel pending recoveries during timelock
- **Inactivity Inheritance**: Automatic asset transfer to beneficiaries after extended inactivity

### Cross-Chain Verification
- **LayerZero V2 DVNs**: Multiple Decentralized Verifier Networks validate cross-chain messages
- **Peer Validation**: Only trusted contract peers can send/receive messages
- **Message Authentication**: Cryptographic verification of all cross-chain communications
- **Replay Protection**: Nonce-based system prevents duplicate transactions

### Asset Protection
- **Token Tracking**: Monitor and protect both fungible and non-fungible tokens
- **Cross-Chain Assets**: Support for assets on multiple blockchains
- **Emergency Freezing**: Vault owners can temporarily freeze assets during suspicious activity

## üìñ Usage Guide

### 1. Initialize Your Vault

**Step 1: Connect Wallets**
1. Open the ReclaimX application
2. Connect your Solana wallet (Phantom/Solflare)
3. Connect your Ethereum wallet (MetaMask)
4. Ensure both wallets have sufficient funds for transactions

**Step 2: Create Vault**
1. Navigate to the "Vault Management" tab
2. Click "Initialize New Vault"
3. Configure vault parameters:
   - **Guardian Threshold**: Number of approvals needed (e.g., 2 of 3)
   - **Timelock Duration**: Security delay (24-168 hours recommended)
   - **Inactivity Period**: Time before inheritance triggers (6-12 months)
   - **Backup Wallet**: Beneficiary address for inheritance
   - **Stake Amount**: RXOFT tokens required from guardians

### 2. Add Guardians

**Guardian Requirements:**
- Must have wallets on supported chains
- Must stake minimum RXOFT tokens
- Should be trusted individuals (family, close friends)
- Must understand their responsibilities

**Adding Process:**
1. Go to the "Guardian Management" tab
2. Click "Add Guardian"
3. Enter guardian details:
   - Wallet address
   - Blockchain (Solana/Ethereum)
   - Contact information (optional)
4. **Critical**: Ensure guardians span at least 2 different chains
5. Set appropriate threshold (60%+ recommended for high security)

### 3. Guardian Staking

**For Guardians:**
1. Receive RXOFT tokens (provided by vault owner or purchased)
2. Navigate to "Staking Interface"
3. Approve token spending
4. Stake required amount to activate guardian status
5. Monitor staking rewards and slashing risks

**Staking Benefits:**
- Earn rewards for honest participation
- Voting power in recovery decisions
- Access to governance features

**Slashing Risks:**
- False recovery approvals (3+ strikes)
- Malicious behavior detection
- Automatic token burning for violations

### 4. Initiate Recovery

**From Solana:**
1. Go to "Recovery Management" tab
2. Click "Initiate Cross-Chain Recovery"
3. Fill recovery details:
   - Old wallet address (to recover from)
   - New wallet address (destination)
   - Target chain (Ethereum)
   - Recovery reason (optional)
4. Pay LayerZero messaging fees
5. Submit recovery request

**From Ethereum:**
1. Connect MetaMask to Ethereum network
2. Use the same recovery interface
3. LayerZero will route the message to Solana vault
4. Monitor transaction on LayerZero Scan

### 5. Guardian Voting Process

**For Guardians:**
1. Receive recovery notification (email/app notification)
2. Navigate to "Guardian Dashboard"
3. Review recovery request details:
   - Requester identity verification
   - Recovery destination address
   - Supporting evidence/documentation

6. Monitor voting progress and threshold status

**Voting Considerations:**
- Verify requester identity through multiple channels
- Check recovery destination address carefully
- Consider timing and circumstances of request
- Communicate with other guardians if needed

### 6. Execute Recovery

**Execution Process:**
1. Once guardian threshold is reached, timelock begins
2. Monitor timelock countdown in "Recovery Status"
3. After timelock expires, anyone can execute recovery
4. Execution triggers asset transfer to new wallet
5. Original owner can cancel during timelock period

**Post-Recovery:**
- Update vault configuration with new owner
- Notify all guardians of successful recovery
- Consider rotating guardians if compromise suspected
- Update backup wallet and beneficiary information

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

### Multi-Chain Guardian Distribution

**Mandatory Requirements:**
- Guardians must be distributed across at least 2 different blockchains
- No single chain can hold majority of guardian voting power
- Minimum 3 guardians recommended, maximum 7 for efficiency

**Security Rationale:**
- Prevents single-chain attacks and network failures
- Ensures recovery availability during chain downtime
- Distributes trust across different ecosystems
- Reduces correlation risk between guardians

### Guardian Staking Security

**Staking Requirements:**
- Minimum stake: 1000 RXOFT tokens per guardian
- Stake lockup: 30 days minimum after guardian removal
- Slashing conditions: 3+ false approvals trigger 50% slash
- Reward distribution: 5% APY for honest participation

**Anti-Gaming Measures:**
- Reputation scoring based on historical behavior
- Progressive slashing (increasing penalties for repeat offenses)
- Community governance for dispute resolution
- Insurance fund for legitimate recovery failures

### Best Practices for Users

**Guardian Selection:**
1. **Trusted Individuals**: Choose family members, close friends, or professional services
2. **Geographic Distribution**: Spread guardians across different locations and time zones
3. **Technical Competence**: Ensure guardians understand the recovery process
4. **Communication Channels**: Maintain multiple ways to contact guardians
5. **Regular Updates**: Periodically verify guardian availability and contact information

**Vault Configuration:**
1. **Threshold Settings**: Use at least 60% threshold for high-security vaults
2. **Timelock Duration**: Longer periods (72+ hours) for high-value wallets
3. **Inactivity Periods**: Set realistic timeframes (6-12 months) for inheritance
4. **Backup Wallets**: Use secure, offline-generated addresses for beneficiaries
5. **Regular Audits**: Review and update vault settings annually

**Operational Security:**
1. **Private Key Management**: Never share private keys with guardians
2. **Recovery Documentation**: Maintain secure records of vault configuration
3. **Guardian Communication**: Use encrypted channels for sensitive discussions
4. **Monitoring**: Regularly check vault status and guardian activity
5. **Emergency Procedures**: Have plans for various failure scenarios
